        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello there, my name is Wakie Ul Haque. Yes, my name does sound like the communication device known as the walkie-talkie. I am a recent Mechanical Engineer graduate from the University of California Riverside. A little about my backround. I was born and raised in Los Angeles,CA. I grew up in a very diverse and hippie area better known as Silverlake. Reason being why it is so diverse is because of it's location which is near a big immigrant community from many cultures. There is a very big melting pot. Both my parents are from Bangladesh. My father had immigrated before my mother, who'm he he had brought later on and when my older sister had been only a year old. I hold onto who I am very much. My culture has made me into the person I am today. To respect and continue my heritage, is a blessing. My parents have taught me, never to take the easiest paths, as it is the path that those who don't work hard or try take. I am no follower of that. I have worked very hard to grow as a person and learner. My studies have gone to good use, as now I am a Graduate Magna Charta. This acheivement is only the beggining to what I have to offer. I adapt well to siutations where I can take the lead with the help of my peers and assist them as well. I want to offer companies my expertiese a mechanical engineer, not only to gorw their brand but their reach. Let's do this togther!   <br><br>

        Hobbies: I love to play babseball, go to car meets, build PCs and components, and lastly food! These hobbies make me unique to work in any environment as I like to try things I never have. My biggest has to be baseball. Baseball was a sport I never played nor understood till late eight-grade. I was a South Asian boy, who was focused on the most common sports kids of my race played, being basketball and soccer. But no one played baseball, even though culturally cricket is the most similar and played sport in South Asia. One day I wanted to try the game of baseball, and soon became the greatest four years of my life. I wasn't good at all in the beggining. I had zero experience. But, through countless hours spent during practices, weekend games, and get togethers, I got better. With all that hardwork, I got moved up to varsity my junior year. Hard work does pay off.  <br><br>
